    <pre>
    Create a class declaration that deals with any initialization, shared
    properties and methods.

    Any extra methods and properties that need to be augmented to the class
    declaration after it’s been defined can be added to the prototype. These
    will be added to all instances, even those that have already been created.

    Add any properties or methods that are individual to a particular
    instance can be augmented using assignment to that object (a mixin
    could be used to add multiple properties at once, as we’ll see later).

    Be careful when overwriting the prototype completely ― the constructor
    class needs to be reset.

    <h2>To string</h2>
    <pre class="code">
    [1,2,3].toString()
    << '1,2,3'
    
    2..toString; // remember 2 dot operators for integers!
    << '2'</pre>

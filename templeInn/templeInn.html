            <h2>House of the Lord</h2>
            <p>
                Temples are literally houses of the Lord. They are holy places of worship where individuals make sacred
                covenants with God. Because making covenants with God is such a solemn responsibility, individuals
                cannot enter the temple to receive their endowments or be sealed in marriage for eternity until they
                have fully prepared themselves and been members of the Church for at least a year. Throughout history,
                the Lord has commanded His people to build temples. The Church is working to build temples all over the
                world to make temple blessings more available for a greater number of Heavenly Father’s children.
            </p>
            <h3>Places of Learning</h3>
            <p onClick="toggle_show('hiddentext')" class="readmore">read more...&#x2935;</p>
            <div id="hiddentext" style="display:none">
                <p>
                    Temples are places of learning. Their principal purpose is to provide ordinances necessary for the
                    children of God to enable them to return to dwell with Him. Temple ordinances lead to the greatest
                    blessings available through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Everything in the Church﻿—the meetings
                    and
                    activities, the missionary efforts, the lessons taught and the hymns﻿—all lead to the work done in
                    holy
                    temples.
                    <br>
                    One ordinance received in the temple is called the endowment. The word endowment means “gift,” and
                    the
                    temple endowment truly is a gift from God. The ordinance consists of a series of instructions and
                    includes covenants to live righteously and follow the requirements of the gospel. The endowment
                    focuses
                    on the Savior, His role in Heavenly Father’s plan, and the personal commitment of each member to
                    follow
                    Him.
                    <br>
                    Another temple ordinance is celestial marriage. In this ordinance husband and wife are sealed to one
                    another for eternity. A sealing performed in the temple continues forever if the husband and wife
                    are
                    faithful to the covenants they make.
                    <br>
                    Children born to parents who have been sealed in the temple are born in the covenant. These children
                    automatically become part of an eternal family. Children who are not born in the covenant can also
                    become part of an eternal family once their natural or adoptive parents have been sealed to one
                    another.
                    The ordinance of sealing children to parents is performed in the temple.
                    <br>
                    People who have died without these essential gospel ordinances may receive those ordinances through
                    the
                    work done in temples. Acting in behalf of ancestors and others who have died, Church members are
                    baptized and confirmed, receive the endowment, and participate in the sealings of husband to wife
                    and
                    children to parents.
                    <br>
                    Those who enter the temple must be worthy, which means that they keep the commandments and are
                    prepared
                    to make and keep sacred temple covenants. In two interviews﻿—one with a member of a bishopric or a
                    branch president and another with a member of a stake presidency or a mission president﻿—Church
                    members
                    certify their worthiness to enter the temple. In these interviews, the priesthood leader asks about
                    the
                    individual’s personal conduct and worthiness. Those who are worthy receive a temple recommend, which
                    allows them to enter the temple.
                </p>
                <h3>Temple Clothing</h3>
                <p>
                    When individuals go to the temple, they should wear their best clothing, as they do when they attend
                    church. When they are inside the temple, they exchange their clothing for the white clothing of the
                    temple. This change of clothing takes place in a dressing room, where each person uses a locker and
                    a
                    private dressing space. In the temple, modesty is carefully maintained.
                    <br>
                    As individuals put their clothing in the locker, they can leave all their worldly distractions
                    behind.
                    Dressed in white, they can feel a oneness and a sense of equality with others in the temple, for
                    everyone around them is similarly dressed.
                </p>
                <h4>Wearing the Temple Garment</h4>
                <p>
                    Once people are endowed, they have the blessing of wearing the temple garment throughout their
                    lives.
                    They are obligated to wear it according to the instructions given in the endowment. Those who have
                    been
                    endowed in the temple must remember that the blessings that are related to this sacred privilege
                    depend
                    on their worthiness and their faithfulness in keeping temple covenants.
                    <br>
                    The garment provides a constant reminder of the covenants made in the temple. The garment should be
                    treated with respect at all times. It should not be exposed to the view of those who do not
                    understand
                    its significance, and it should not be adjusted to accommodate different styles of clothing. When
                    worn
                    properly, the garment provides protection against temptation and evil. Wearing the garment is an
                    outward
                    expression of an inward commitment to follow the Savior.
                </p>
                <h3>Blessings from Attending the Temple</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to being a place where sacred priesthood ordinances are performed, the temple is a place
                    of
                    peace and revelation. It is a place where spiritual guidance can be received for crucial decisions
                    or
                    concerns.
                    <br>
                    The Lord blesses those who attend to the sacred ordinance work in the temple. And the blessings He
                    gives
                    will not be limited to the time spent in the temple. Those who do temple work will be blessed in all
                    aspects of their lives. Their labors in the temple will strengthen them and refine them spiritually.
